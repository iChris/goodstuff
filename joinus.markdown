If you're interested in bringing your podcast - existing or brand new - to Goodstuff, we'd love to chat.

# What We're Looking For

There isn't a specific formula of podcast that will fit on Goodstuff - it has more to do with the feeling we hope listeners might get when listening to a show published on Goodstuff. Something being "good" is fairly subjective, but we want podcasts we help produce to be:

* **Friendly on the ears** We aim for as good a quality show as the hosts are financially able to produce. This doesn't mean having the most expensive gear or studio voices - but that efforts are made to ensure the podcast is enjoyable to listen to without distracting audio issues.
* **Positive in tone** We love debate and healthy discussions. We're not fans of podcasts built around tearing down, insulting, anger, or hate. Swearing or other adult language is fine as long as the episodes are marked appropriately.
* **Consistency** Life happens. We get that. If you say to your audience you're going to do something, do it. And if you don't, acknowledge that you didn't follow through and get back on that podcasting horse or bicycle or whatever your preferred mode of transportation is.
